## [0:00 - 0:25] HOOK & PROBLEM STATEMENT

**[On Screen: Statistics overlay, hospital footage]**

> "Every year, over 200,000 cancer patients could benefit from clinical trials—but fewer than 5% ever enroll. The bottleneck? Matching. Oncologists are drowning in thousands of active trials, each with pages of complex eligibility criteria. A single patient review can take hours. Trials go unfilled. Patients miss life-saving opportunities."

**[Pause, transition to app screen]**

> "We built Cliniq to change that."

## [0:25 - 0:50] INTRODUCING CLINIQ & GEMINI INTEGRATION

**[On Screen: App dashboard, Gemini logo]**

> "Cliniq is an AI-powered clinical trial matching assistant built on **Google Gemini 2.0**. Unlike traditional keyword search, Gemini acts as a reasoning engine—it *understands* medical logic. It reads eligibility criteria like a human would, interpreting complex conditions like 'must have received prior taxane unless contraindicated.'"

> "And it's multimodal. Text, voice, images—Gemini processes them all."

---

## [0:50 - 1:20] FEATURE 1: SCREENER MODE (Multimodal Extraction)

**[On Screen: Screener Mode demo]**

> "Let me show you. In **Screener Mode**, I paste a messy clinical note: '55-year-old female with triple-negative breast cancer, stage IV, progressed on pembrolizumab...' "

**[Action: Paste text, click search]**

> "Gemini instantly extracts a structured patient profile—cancer type, stage, biomarkers, prior treatments—no manual data entry."

**[Action: Show image upload]**

> "I can also upload a photo of a pathology report or EMR screenshot. Gemini reads it and extracts the same structured data."

**[Action: Show matched trials appearing]**

> "Within seconds, I get semantically matched trials—ranked by fit score with clear explanations of *why* each trial matches or doesn't."

---

## [1:20 - 1:55] FEATURE 2: LISTENER MODE (Ambient Intelligence)

**[On Screen: Listener Mode with microphone animation]**

> "But what if you're in the middle of a consultation? That's where **Listener Mode** comes in."

> "It runs in the background, transcribing the conversation in real-time using OpenAI Whisper. When it detects that standard treatment options have been exhausted—phrases like 'we've tried everything' or 'disease progression'—it automatically triggers a trial search."

**[Action: Show ambient detection triggering search]**

> "The doctor doesn't have to stop and search. Cliniq proactively nudges with relevant trials at exactly the right moment."

---

## [1:55 - 2:25] FEATURE 3: CLINICAL RADAR (Real-Time Safety Monitoring)

**[On Screen: Clinical Radar dashboard with alerts]**

> "Cliniq doesn't just match trials—it monitors them. **Clinical Radar** is our ambient safety feature."

> "It tracks every drug your patients are on. With one click, it performs a live web search using **Gemini's Google Search grounding**—pulling real FDA warnings, regulatory updates, and competitor developments with actual citations."

**[Action: Show alerts with severity colors, source links]**

> "High-severity alerts—like black box warnings—are flagged immediately. And here's the best part..."

**[Action: Play audio briefing]**

> "It generates a daily audio briefing—a 60-second podcast summarizing everything, so doctors can listen on their commute."

---

## [2:25 - 2:45] FEATURE 4: CHART PEEK (Population Health View)

**[On Screen: Chart Peek with patient list]**

> "Finally, **Chart Peek** is our population health view. It continuously monitors your saved patient cohort, automatically flagging when new trials open that match existing patients."

> "No more manual re-checks. Cliniq keeps watching."

---

## [2:45 - 3:00] REAL-WORLD IMPACT & CLOSING

**[On Screen: Impact statistics, team/hackathon logo]**

> "Cliniq addresses a critical bottleneck in cancer care. By automating the matching process with AI that truly *reasons*, we can help more patients find trials faster—and potentially save lives."

> "Built for the Agentic AI App Hackathon, powered by Google Gemini. This is Cliniq."
